# pestySwarms

Current problem: pesticide use can lead to environmental pollution and harm farmer health.    Current gap: Existing drone companies have limited efficiency due to using few drones. This project intends to use a swarm of terrestrial robots to search and remove agricultural pests. The competitive advantages include: Efficient search, fault-tolerance and scalability.    The basic proof of concept would involve identifying pests vs healthy plants, and implementing it on >1 robots scalable via a swarm intelligence algorithm (e.g. particle swarm optimization).   

Feb 24: a computer vision algorithm is written to distinguish oranges, which represents pests. It is implemented on a robotic arm with 360 vision.
